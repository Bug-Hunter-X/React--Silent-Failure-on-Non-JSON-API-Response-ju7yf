# React: Silent Failure on Non-JSON API Response

This example demonstrates a common error in React applications where an API response that isn't valid JSON causes the application to fail silently. The component fetches data using `fetch`, handles loading and error states, but doesn't explicitly check if the response is parsable as JSON before attempting to use it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficulty in debugging.

## Bug
The provided `bug.js` shows the faulty component. It correctly handles HTTP errors, but fails silently if the server returns a non-JSON response.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` provides a corrected version. It explicitly checks the response's `Content-Type` header to verify it's JSON before parsing.  If not, it handles this as an error, providing more informative feedback to the user.  This is a more robust error handling approach, making the application more resilient to unexpected responses.
